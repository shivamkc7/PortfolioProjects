Summary:

Conducted yearlong research building 15+ ANN and ordered probit models to accurately predict soccer games in the English Premier League

Discovered the second-best predictive accuracy of 53.5% among related work 

Culminated in 65+ page paper and an oral defense 


"Data Cleansing, EDA and Data Modeling" folder contains the R Studio codes that I used to clean the data , visualize the data, and build Artificial Neural Networks and Ordered Probit Models for the project. The folder also contains some cleaned data.
"IS Defense.pptx" is my oral defense.
"IS First Presentation.pptx" is my introductory presentation to the project idea I had.
"Shivam_KC_Senior_Year_Thesis.pdf" is my thesis paper.
